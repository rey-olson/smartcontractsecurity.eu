Which of course, I did. When I browsed their website, I stumbled upon this magnificient zero-knowledge (\"ZK\") security workshop they organised together with <a href=\"https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/secureum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secureum </a>in October-November 2023 👇</p>\n<h4 class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/veridise/zk-security-workshop-recap-winners-and-presentations-9c105dfab7de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ZK Security Workshop recap: Winners and presentations</a><br><br></h4>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Especially helpful are the lecture slides, all provided by Veridise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An Intro to ZK languages and Frameworks (Kostas Ferles, CRO)</li>\n<li>Abstracting ZK Circuits with Graphs (Daniel Dominguez, Security Engineer)</li>\n<li>Static Analysis for ZK Circuits (Kostas Ferles, CRO)</li>\n<li>Underconstrained circuits and the Picus tool (Shankara Pailoor, Research Scientist)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As well as the guest presentation recordings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lessons Learned from Securing Scroll zkEVM (Haichen Shen, Scroll co-founder)</li>\n<li>Circuit Techniques for Scaling Data Access on Ethereum (Yi Sun, Axiom co-founder)</li>\n<li>Tips for safe Circom circuits (Blockdev, Ethereum Foundation’s PSE team, software engineer)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Curious about zero-knowledge technology?</h3>\n<p>Before diving into the security implications of zero-knowledge tech, I suggest you start with the basics. The <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/zero-knowledge-proofs/\">Ethereum Foundation</a> has a nice introduction on zero-knowledge proofs, as well as <a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof-and-how-does-it-impact-blockchain\">Binance Academy</a> <em>(don't shoot me for linking to Binance, it is an informative article, written by Kenny Li, co-founder of Manta Network).</em></p>\n<h5>For more resources on zk tech feel free to check-out:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://zkintro.com/\">zkintro</a> (introduction and practical programming course)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://zk-learning.org/\">zk-learning</a> (MOOC, spring 2023 - but the resources are still available online)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://zksecurity.xyz/blog/\">ZKSECURITY</a> (⚠️ watch out, this seems to be pretty advanced stuff)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs\">Awesome zero knowledge proofs by Matter Labs</a> (yet another curated list 😅)</li>\n<li>Rareskills <a href=\"https://www.rareskills.io/zk-book\">zk-book</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.rareskills.io/zk-bootcamp\">zk-bootcamp</a> (⚠️ watch out, these are <em>not </em>free)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Additional reading by Veridise</h3>\n<p>There are more gems on the Veridise blog, for example <a href=\"https://medium.com/veridise/breakdown-of-100-security-audits-key-insights-from-1605-vulnerability-findings-0f12d830572e\">Breakdown of 100 security audits: Key insights from 1605 vulnerability findings</a>.</p>\n<p>I think the views from the article align with my perception that, more recently, the larger losses stem from a) \"old school\" hacks (e.g. private key theft through social engineering attacks), b) business logic errors. I don't always closely follow the latest news with regards to exploits, but I have the impression that reentrancy attacks and so forth are not as popular as they were before. I guess due to projects improving their smart contract security game (higher code quality, more code audit(s) before go-live, ...)</p>",

Inspired by international cybersecurity frameworks such as the ISO 27000 standard, the required security measures are a de facto minimum nowadays, and should be common sense practices by now.</p>\n<p>Besides the <a href=\"https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora/\">Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)</a>, which is aimed <em>exclusively at the European financial sector</em>, the NIS2 directive is probably <strong>the most encompassing security regulation in Europe</strong>. NIS2 is a revision of the 2016 NIS directive and the most significant change is that it expands its scope to <em>more sectors.</em></p>\n<p>In order to help organizations comply with NIS2, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) compiled a list of minimum requirements, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-policy/nis-directive-new/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services\">Minimum Security Measures for Operators of Essentials Services</a>. You can filter on sector (e.g. financial sector, digital infrastructure, ...) as well as on country. The latter lists additional \"national controls\" stemming from country specific, local legislation (currently only Cyprus, France, Germany and Sweden have listed such national controls).</p>\n<p>ENISA luckily did not reinvent the wheel, its minimum security measures are based on existing international standards, such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ISO 27001</li>\n<li>NIST Cybersecurity Framework <em>(please note NIST recently released an updated version: <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework\">NIST CSF 2.0</a>)</em></li>\n<li>ISA/IEC 62443</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the financial sector specifically, and a bit arbitrarily because some of these come from US regulation(?!), ENISA <em>additionally </em>mapped security measures from the following regulations and/or standards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)</li>\n<li>ISO Standard 13569 - Financial services -- Information security guidelines</li>\n<li>GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)</li>\n<li>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)</li>\n<li>(Revised) Payment Services Directive (PSD2)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">In Belgium, the NIS2 compentent authority, Center for Cybersecurity Belgium, (CCB) compiled this guidance into the <a href=\"https://www.cyfun.be\">CyberFundamentals Framework (CyFun.be)</a> (that bad pun was most certainly intended...)</p>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<h4>I.

The governance framework should be proportionate to their risk, size, complexity and systemic importance, and to the financial stability risk that may be posed by activity or market in which the crypto-asset issuers and service providers are participating. It should provide for clear and direct lines of responsibility and accountability for the functions and activities they are conducting.<br><br></li>\n<li><strong>Recommendation 5: Risk management</strong><br>Authorities, as appropriate, should require crypto-asset service providers to have an effective risk management framework in place that comprehensively addresses all material risks associated with their activities. The framework should be proportionate to the risk, size, complexity, and systemic importance, and to the financial stability risk that may be posed by the activity or market in which they are participating.
