            "title": "A Critical Look at PwC’s Digital Euro Cost Study",
            "content_html": "<p>In June 2025 I came across this study by PwC <em>(note that it was commissioned by the European Association of Co-operative Banks (EACB), the European Banking Federation (EBF) and the European Savings and Retail Banking Group (ESBG) - so take it with a grain of salt</em>🧂<em>considering the interests of these organisations...):</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pwc.de/de/finanzdienstleistungen/pwc-digital-euro-cost-study-2025.pdf\">https://www.pwc.de/de/finanzdienstleistungen/pwc-digital-euro-cost-study-2025.pdf</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>\n<p>The cost estimate depends largely on the size of the banks together with other characteristics such as their structure (centralised or decentralised), with <strong>average change cost estimated at 110 million euro per bank</strong>, excluding offline, multiple accounts and merchant acquiring (i.e., the cost for the processing of payments). In line with the scope of this study, this figure represents only a part of the total costs to be covered for the introduction of the digital euro. If the results of this study are extrapolated to the entire euro area, the total change cost for banks in the euro area could amount to 18 billion euro.<br>Main cost drivers relate to technical adjustments (e.g., intermediary applications, interfaces and ATM infrastructure), which account for around 75% of the estimated total costs of participating banks (&gt; 1.5 billion euro). Additionally, the introduction of the digital euro will not only entail considerable financial resources but also significant deployment of personnel from across various areas of expertise. On average, respondents assume that almost 46% of the resources with relevant skills would be tied up per year – some banks assume even higher capacities –which would materially limit the innovative ability of the banks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I did not have empirical results to back up my claims: these figures seem highly exaggerated. I get that new implementations cost money (often a lot of money - yes, I am looking at you PSD2 regulation, that enacted Open Banking in the EU). But come on, €110M is a <em>shitload </em>of money. Let me break this down.</p>\n<p>PwC used a three layer model to structure the estimates for major digital euro<br>cost drivers: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>1. Commercial layer</strong> focuses on the go-to-market approach and customer relationships;<br><strong>2. Technical layer</strong> covers technology and infrastructure including (mobile) banking applications, physical card, ATMs, branch networks, POS terminals, as well as functionalities the rulebook lists as liquidity and access management;<br><strong>3. Operational layer</strong> takes a closer look at core back-office processes, such as fee calculation, reporting, and payment statistics, to support the seamless integration of the digital euro.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/media/posts/115//Distribution-of-costs-across-the-PwC-Payment-Layer-Model.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1114\" height=\"445\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/media/posts/115//responsive/Distribution-of-costs-across-the-PwC-Payment-Layer-Model-xs.png 300w ,https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/media/posts/115//responsive/Distribution-of-costs-across-the-PwC-Payment-Layer-Model-sm.png 480w ,https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/media/posts/115//responsive/Distribution-of-costs-across-the-PwC-Payment-Layer-Model-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Distribution of costs across the PwC Payment Layer Model (source: Digital Euro Cost Study by PwC)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>75% of €110M = €82,5M. I understand large banks rely on ancient technology such as mainframes and need to integrate with ATM technolgy (which might even make the IBM zSeries look modern), but approx. € 80M to integrate some sort of new front-end wallet functionality in their online banking app, as well as a back-end integration? That seems far fetched - or just your common corporate bureaucratic bullshit camouflaged as a research report.</p>\n<p>/end of rant</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@skyler_tv?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Skyler Smith</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/white-and-black-panda-graffiti-PyC9jj2pNvc?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a></p>",

And after reading about the post-mortem of ByBit's $1.5B hack even more so!</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7lP_0h-PPvY?si=4zIQyUTTVhcxdvG3\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>However, after watching the video I cannot help to think <strong>how absurd the notion is that users should jump through these hoops to verify a transaction.</strong></p>\n<p>I understand the sentiment that if you handle (really) large amounts of money, then you should take the greatest care to verify if everything is okidoki. But these steps seem unreasonable to me, as an outsider looking in.</p>\n<p>The proposed approach probably works in practice (and perhaps it is the only reasonably secure way of working for now), but I reckon this is <strong>user experience hell</strong> in reality. Even for experienced users.</p>\n<p><em>(I like Patrick's suggestions to wallet providers to enhance the transaction verification flow, but it seems a moot point when zooming out)</em></p>\n<p>To give an example, lots of large organizations move (really) large amounts of money, and they generally rely on the (implicit perhaps) security of the tools they are using. When initiating, approving or executing transactions (often supported by multi-factor authentication combined with four-eye or even six-eye approval flows) they do not question whether what the application UI shows them is correct.</p>\n<p>Why should we worry about this then, when dealing with cryptocurrencies? <em>(Hint: because crypto security is still dubious? Yes I know, traditional finance and other industries are not necessarily doing any better).</em></p>\n<h4>Analogy time</h4>\n<p>As an analogy (considering we all agree human safety is pretty important): people do not verify if the firmware of their car has been tampered with before taking it for a drive (You <em>could </em>die, right? The worst possible outcome).</p>\n<p>Probably not the best analogy<sup>2</sup>, but I hope you get my point:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">People constantly make </span><em style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">really </em><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">important trust assumptions. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Perhaps it is time for the crypto industry to live up to user's security expectations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">People deserve to be able to trust their crypto applications to be secure, and their funds to be safe.</strong></p>\n<h4>To (not) trust middleware</h4>\n<p>Idem dito with the hesitance of relying on middleware providers such as Metamask. I mean at some point in the flow you will <em>have to</em> rely on third-parties (and their security). If you use a certain wallet, you rely on the provider's secure implementation (cue the discussion on closed-source versus open-source). You also trust in the protocols, applications you are using, don't you?</p>\n<p>You can try to remove as many dependencies as possible, but often you are just moving / shifting your trust (boundaries). That is maybe a topic for another article.</p>\n<h4>End of rant</h4>\n<p>After consideration I realize this post has become a bit of rant. I admit it is easy to point out problems, but that it is much harder to come up with (great) solutions. I'll give it some more time to gather my thoughts, but everything starts with acknowledging there is a problem <em>and</em> what that problem is exactly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<p><em><sup>[1]</sup> By the way Patrick, everyone: I genuinely dislike these click-baity video thumbnails with surprised faces on them.

On the other hand: advanced targeted attacks, where (amongst others) private keys are stolen, with bigger pay-outs, seem to be on the rise. Bybit and WazirX (hacked in July 2024 for $230M) are prime examples of this. Caveat: the top 10 largest hacks according to <a href=\"https://rekt.news/leaderboard/\">https://rekt.news/leaderboard/</a> are a mixed bag (i.e. targeted CEX hacks, DeFi hacks), so take my opinion with a grain of salt (I am no scientist, just following my gut-feeling here).<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>I was surprised to read about Safe{Wallet}'s involvement<br></strong>I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">was</span> <em>am<sup>[1]</sup> </em>going to publish an article on Patrick Collins' guide on <a href=\"https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/verify-safe-multi-sig-wallet-signatures-radiant-capital-hack\">Hardware Wallet Multi-Sig Verification</a>, that refers to Safe{Wallet}. I was under the impression Safe had their security pretty well under control <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">(and apparently they do: Safe claims their services were not compromised during the Bybit hack)</span> <em>Update: apparently they did not - the attack is confirmed to have been carried out through a compromised Safe{Wallet} developer machine, see <a href=\"https://x.com/safe/status/1894768522720350673\">here (x.com)</a></em>. It is however a tad surprising to see them ship additional security improvements to their product within 72 hours after the incident... Seems like they needed this incident to expedite the release of these security features - I wonder how those internal discussions went...<br><br>Anyway, proper cryptographic key management piques my interest (because it still seems like black magic to me) and if I don't understand something, I dive in deeper <em>(disclaimer: I do not work at a crypto company, nor do I have any hands-on experience whatsoever with \"institutional grade\" crypto custody solutions. I remain quite skeptical about all the sales mumbo jumbo that is thrown around - it is often nothing more than a word soup)<br><br></em></li>\n<li><strong>I was (and was not) surprised to see the issue was at the authorization layer</strong><br>Implementing a fraud proof, least-privilege transaction approval mechanism with adequate seggregation-of-duties <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">AND one that is practical</span> (i.e. it can be used by normal humans without driving them mad) is quite a challenge. Messing up is not unheard of, especially if your adversary is North-Korea and they are actively targetting you...<br><br></li>\n<li><strong>I was not surprised to see our North-Korea friends behind this attack</strong><br>These guys are no idiots. Why bother hacking traditional finance institutions (that usually have better than average security), when you can plunder wealhty crypto organizations/bros/... that have the security posture of a typical start-up (if any at all). I am not sure why other countries are not doing exactly the same (e.g. Iran has a massive cyber army, but I guess... they don't need crypto? Perhaps they have sufficient money or resources or other options to circumvent Western sanctions). I am also quite curious on how the attackers will manage to launder $1,500,000,000 clean. I will definitely read up on that aspect (Chainalysis' crypto crime report actually has some information on this!)</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p><em><sup>[1]</sup> There is so much stuff happening online, at such a ludicrous speed... it borders on insanity. I can not, will not ever be able, to keep up (side note: I am also trying to keep up with AI developments). Besides, I am also reading (offline; physical books) much more lately, so that is why I have not come around to actually publish another article the past months. And of course, life also happens </em>🤷</p>\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@foulsterr?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Frankie Cordoba</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/a-woman-sitting-on-the-ground-smoking-a-cigarette-zxw1FUarR9c?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a></p>\n<p>By the way, first post of 2025!

He is one of the OG's of crypto security on crypto twitter, so more than worth a mention.</p>\n<p>So here it goes, a post dedicated to his treasure trove of a GitHub reposity with <em>tons </em>of security related resources:</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/OffcierCia/\"><strong>https://github.com/OffcierCia/</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>He has published multiple guides, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"mr-2 flex-self-stretch\"><a href=\"https://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap\">Crypto OpSec SelfGuard RoadMap</a>: in layman's term, this is a guide on how to protect yourself when managing your cryptocurrencies. Depending on the situation and circumstances you are in (e.g. are you a high-net-worth individual, a broke-ass degen, or somewhere in between), you can take different protection measures. If you are curious about whether there is anything else (with regard to security) you should do, then have a look.</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OffcierCia/On-Chain-Investigations-Tools-List\">Awesome On-Chain Investigations Handbook</a>: have you ever wanted to know how to investigate or track cryptocurrencies/tokens/...? Then this is your guide, it is filled with tools you can use, as well as guides on how to properly employ them. Think <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/\">BellingCat </a>(perhaps on steroids) for Web3. 😉</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beware that he has a tendency to add many hyperlinks in his texts, so brace yourself for a <em>very deep</em> rabbithole if you want to read through all of his material. I also noticed he dives deep into, as well as covers a broad set of, topics (clearly inspired by a military or intelligence agency mindset - hence his nickname). This is an great approach for security peers, but from a typical end-user perspective it gets rather quickly too complex. This is one of the many challenges we need to tackle as security specialists: to condense (seemingly infinitely) complex topics into clear and concise guidance. But I digress.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Besides Twitter, you can also follow his blog <a href=\"https://officercia.mirror.xyz\">officercia.mirror.xyz</a><a href=\"officercia.mirror.xyz\" title=\"officercia.mirror.xyz\"></a></p>",

When I browsed their website, I stumbled upon this magnificient zero-knowledge (\"ZK\") security workshop they organised together with <a href=\"https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/secureum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secureum </a>in October-November 2023 👇</p>\n<h4 class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/veridise/zk-security-workshop-recap-winners-and-presentations-9c105dfab7de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ZK Security Workshop recap: Winners and presentations</a><br><br></h4>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Especially helpful are the lecture slides, all provided by Veridise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An Intro to ZK languages and Frameworks (Kostas Ferles, CRO)</li>\n<li>Abstracting ZK Circuits with Graphs (Daniel Dominguez, Security Engineer)</li>\n<li>Static Analysis for ZK Circuits (Kostas Ferles, CRO)</li>\n<li>Underconstrained circuits and the Picus tool (Shankara Pailoor, Research Scientist)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As well as the guest presentation recordings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lessons Learned from Securing Scroll zkEVM (Haichen Shen, Scroll co-founder)</li>\n<li>Circuit Techniques for Scaling Data Access on Ethereum (Yi Sun, Axiom co-founder)</li>\n<li>Tips for safe Circom circuits (Blockdev, Ethereum Foundation’s PSE team, software engineer)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Curious about zero-knowledge technology?</h3>\n<p>Before diving into the security implications of zero-knowledge tech, I suggest you start with the basics. The <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/zero-knowledge-proofs/\">Ethereum Foundation</a> has a nice introduction on zero-knowledge proofs, as well as <a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof-and-how-does-it-impact-blockchain\">Binance Academy</a> <em>(don't shoot me for linking to Binance, it is an informative article, written by Kenny Li, co-founder of Manta Network).</em></p>\n<h5>For more resources on zk tech feel free to check-out:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://zkintro.com/\">zkintro</a> (introduction and practical programming course)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://zk-learning.org/\">zk-learning</a> (MOOC, spring 2023 - but the resources are still available online)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cryptohack.org/challenges/zkp/\">ZKPs by CryptoHack</a> (</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://zksecurity.xyz/blog/\">ZKSECURITY</a> (⚠️ watch out, this seems to be pretty advanced stuff)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs\">Awesome zero knowledge proofs by Matter Labs</a> (yet another curated list 😅)</li>\n<li>Rareskills <a href=\"https://www.rareskills.io/zk-book\">zk-book</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.rareskills.io/zk-bootcamp\">zk-bootcamp</a> (⚠️ watch out, these are <em>not </em>free)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Additional reading by Veridise</h3>\n<p>There are more gems on the Veridise blog, for example <a href=\"https://medium.com/veridise/breakdown-of-100-security-audits-key-insights-from-1605-vulnerability-findings-0f12d830572e\">Breakdown of 100 security audits: Key insights from 1605 vulnerability findings</a>.</p>\n<p>I think the views from the article align with my perception that, more recently, the larger losses stem from a) \"old school\" hacks (e.g. private key theft through social engineering attacks), b) business logic errors. I don't always closely follow the latest news with regards to exploits, but I have the impression that reentrancy attacks and so forth are not as popular as they were before. I guess due to projects improving their smart contract security game (higher code quality, more code audit(s) before go-live, ...)</p>",
