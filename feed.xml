                <p class="msg msg--info">Veridise's <a href="https://www.mikkoikola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mikko Ikola</a> reached out to me to ask if I could list <a href="https://veridise.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veridise</a>, the company, to my published list of <a href="https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/audit-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">audit firms</a>. Which of course, I did. When I browsed their website, I stumbled upon this magnificient zero-knowledge ("ZK") security workshop they organised together with <a href="https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/secureum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secureum </a>in October-November 2023 👇</p>
<h4 class="align-center"><a href="https://medium.com/veridise/zk-security-workshop-recap-winners-and-presentations-9c105dfab7de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZK Security Workshop recap: Winners and presentations</a><br><br></h4>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">Especially helpful are the lecture slides, all provided by Veridise:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Intro to ZK languages and Frameworks (Kostas Ferles, CRO)</li>
<li>Abstracting ZK Circuits with Graphs (Daniel Dominguez, Security Engineer)</li>
<li>Static Analysis for ZK Circuits (Kostas Ferles, CRO)</li>
<li>Underconstrained circuits and the Picus tool (Shankara Pailoor, Research Scientist)</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as the guest presentation recordings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lessons Learned from Securing Scroll zkEVM (Haichen Shen, Scroll co-founder)</li>
<li>Circuit Techniques for Scaling Data Access on Ethereum (Yi Sun, Axiom co-founder)</li>
<li>Tips for safe Circom circuits (Blockdev, Ethereum Foundation’s PSE team, software engineer)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Curious about zero-knowledge technology?</h3>
<p>Before diving into the security implications of zero-knowledge tech, I suggest you start with the basics. The <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/zero-knowledge-proofs/">Ethereum Foundation</a> has a nice introduction on zero-knowledge proofs, as well as <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof-and-how-does-it-impact-blockchain">Binance Academy</a> <em>(don't shoot me for linking to Binance, it is an informative article, written by Kenny Li, co-founder of Manta Network).</em></p>
<hr>
<h3>Additional reading</h3>
<p>There are more gems on the Veridise blog, for example <a href="https://medium.com/veridise/breakdown-of-100-security-audits-key-insights-from-1605-vulnerability-findings-0f12d830572e">Breakdown of 100 security audits: Key insights from 1605 vulnerability findings</a>.</p>
<p>I think the views from the article align with my perception that, more recently, the larger losses stem from a) "old school" hacks (e.g. private key theft through social engineering attacks), b) business logic errors. I don't always closely follow the latest news with regards to exploits, but I have the impression that reentrancy attacks and so forth are not as popular as they were before. I guess due to projects improving their smart contract security game (higher code quality, more code audit(s) before go-live, ...)</p>

                <p class="msg msg--info msg--highlight  ">⚠️ <strong>Warning</strong><br>I am definitely not a lawyer, so please inform yourself properly before relying on this summarised information.</p>
<p>With all the fuss about regulation coming to cryptocurrencies, I have been reading up on global, European and Belgian crypto regulation.</p>
<p>Since the focus of this website is still very much<strong> security focused</strong>, I will try my best to highlight the various security requirements with regard to crypto-assets.</p>
<p>Besides <em>crypto regulation</em>, there is also existing or new <em>security regulation</em>. Most of these are -unsurprisingly- specific to the financial sector. However there is also more encompassing legislation, e.g. the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) or the Critical Entities Resilience (CER) Directive. They all mandate compliance with certain security requirements, for a selection of entities in scope.</p>
<p>Please also note that these requirements often intersect (and overlap 😭) with other risk and compliance domains such as non-financial risk management practices (i.e. operational risk, payment fraud, market abuse), anti-money laundering (know-your-customer, know-your-transaction) etc.</p>
<p>Beware, this subject matter quickly gets pretty complicated... </p>

                <p>The folks at <a href="https://www.sai.be">SAI</a> (a Belgian non-profit association for IT professionals and information scientists) invited me to present a webinar on the current state of blockchain and the security considerations for the technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is blockchain, what are smart contracts and why on earth should you use them anno 2024? We look at contemporary applications of some popular blockchain protocols and also consider what they can offer by business sector. Finally, we zoom in on the security aspects of blockchains and smart contracts; because as the Belgian financial watchdog FSMA so nicely puts it, “The only guarantee in crypto is risk”!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The recording (approx. 1 hour) and slides are paywalled, SAI members can view them <a href="https://www.sai.be/event/details/260/smart-contracts-blockchain-security/">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in a similar session, do not hesitate to reach out. I am always more than happy to share my insights!</p>

<p><a href="https://muellerberndt.medium.com/">Bernhard </a>de-obfuscates and examines two popular crypto wallet drainers (both are, unsurprisingly, Javascript malware):</p>

</ul>
<p>Both are well crafted pieces of malware, capable of some clever tricks, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Receiver addresses for regular and seaport transactions. Low-value assets are drained to these addresses, while high-value assets are drained to previously unused addresses.</li>
<li>It is able to intelligently sort tokens and NFTs based on value, prioritizing the most lucrative assets for extraction.</li>
<li>In most cases, Angel drainer asks the user to send an approval transaction or sign an ERC-2612 permit. If successful, the drainer then notifies its backend to withdraw the victim’s assets. A variety of methods are supported, including:
<ul>
<li>Unstaking and stealing stakes from popular projects like Apes, MAYC, BAYC, Potatoz, and Creepz</li>
<li>Trading NFTs on Blur and OpenSea on behalf of the victim, allowing the attackers to liquidate valuable assets</li>
<li>Stealing LP position NFTs from decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap, Sushiswap, TraderJoe, and QuickSwap</li>
<li>Withdrawing liquidity from Curve and Aave positions</li>
<li>Generically stealing ERC20 tokens and NFTs sorted by value (including looking up valuations on DEXes/NFT exchanges). "</li>

                <p>Tejaswa Rastogi (<a href="https://twitter.com/razzor_tweet">Razzor</a>) did a nice talk on smart contract phishing. He covers some interesting attack vectors, as well as defense mechanisms. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homoglyph injections</strong>, e.g. employing look-alike characters for malicious functions. That fake deposit function is <em>not actually</em> depositing your funds...</li>
<li><strong>Library sideloading</strong>, e.g. calling (malicious) external libraries through DELEGATECALL wich undoubtedly results in an unpleasant surprise (you lose your funds).</li>
<li><strong>Metadata injections</strong>, e.g. hiding malicious functionality (backdoors) in smart contract metadata. Metadata apparently(?) is not included in the contract verification process of Etherscan.</li>

                <p class="msg msg--info">AFAICS, NIS2 does not apply to crypto-assets providers (beware that DORA is, which is similar to NIS2 contentwise), but you can expect regulators under MiCA to require similar cybersecurity measures as required under NIS2. Inspired by international cybersecurity frameworks such as the ISO 27000 standard, the required security measures are a de facto minimum nowadays, and should be common sense practices by now.</p>
<p>Besides the <a href="https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora/">Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)</a>, which is aimed <em>exclusively at the European financial sector</em>, the NIS2 directive is probably <strong>the most encompassing security regulation in Europe</strong>. NIS2 is a revision of the 2016 NIS directive and the most significant change is that it expands its scope to <em>more sectors.</em></p>
<p>In order to help organizations comply with NIS2, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) compiled a list of minimum requirements, e.g. <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-policy/nis-directive-new/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services">Minimum Security Measures for Operators of Essentials Services</a>. You can filter on sector (e.g. financial sector, digital infrastructure, ...) as well as on country. The latter lists additional "national controls" stemming from country specific, local legislation (currently only Cyprus, France, Germany and Sweden have listed such national controls).</p>
<p>ENISA luckily did not reinvent the wheel, its minimum security measures are based on existing international standards, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>ISO 27001</li>
<li>NIST Cybersecurity Framework <em>(please note NIST recently released an updated version: <a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework">NIST CSF 2.0</a>)</em></li>
<li>ISA/IEC 62443</li>
</ul>
<p>For the financial sector specifically, and a bit arbitrarily because some of these come from US regulation(?!), ENISA <em>additionally </em>mapped security measures from the following regulations and/or standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)</li>
<li>ISO Standard 13569 - Financial services -- Information security guidelines</li>
<li>GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)</li>
<li>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)</li>
<li>(Revised) Payment Services Directive (PSD2)</li>
</ul>
<p class="msg msg--info">In Belgium, the NIS2 compentent authority, Center for Cybersecurity Belgium, (CCB) compiled this guidance into the <a href="https://www.cyfun.be">CyberFundamentals Framework (CyFun.be)</a> (that bad pun was most certainly intended...)</p>

        <content type="html">
            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/media/posts/86/claudio-schwarz-v66SXbmDVA-unsplash.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>In July 2023 the FSB (i.e. the Financial Stability Board, <strong>not </strong>the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation 😉) published "its global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities to promote the comprehensiveness and international consistency of regulatory and supervisory approaches" <em>(holy shit, what a sentence)</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/</a> </p>
<p>It actually consists of two sets of recommendations:</p>
<p>I. High-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of <strong>crypto-asset activities and markets.</strong></p>
<p>II. Revised high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision, and oversight of <strong>“global stablecoin” arrangements. </strong><em>(note the "revised" and the different scope)</em></p>
<p class="msg msg--info">If you read the FSB's introductory notes, they explicitly state these recommendations are mainly focused on addressing <em>risks to financial stability</em>, <strong>not </strong>so much specific risk categories such as cyber security, data privacy, etc.</p>
<p>I am (by far) not a policy expert, but if you read the guidelines (see below), I think it is quite obvious the idea here is to regulate crypto-asset providers pretty much the same way as any other (key) player in the financial sector.</p>
<p>I reckon the European <a href="https://smartcontractsecurity.eu/markets-in-crypto-assets-mica-regulation/">MiCA </a> legislation does a pretty good job at translating these recommendations into law. H<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">owever, the main challenge remains: how to regulate DeFi, since there is not (at least not always) a single, centralized party to specifically target. But that is for another article!</span></p>
<h3>Recommendations for the oversight of crypto-asset activities and markets</h3>
<div class="lightweight-accordion-body">
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation 1: Regulatory powers and tools<br></strong>Authorities should have and utilise the appropriate powers and tools, and adequate resources to regulate, supervise, and oversee crypto-asset activities and markets, and enforce relevant laws and regulations effectively, as appropriate.</li>
<li><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Recommendation 2: General regulatory framework<br></strong>Authorities should apply comprehensive and effective regulation, supervision, and oversight to crypto-asset activities and markets – including crypto-asset issuers and service providers – on a functional basis and proportionate to the financial stability risk they pose, or potentially pose, and consistent with authorities’ respective mandates in line with the principle “same activity, same risk, same regulation”.<br><br></li>
<li><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Recommendation 3: Cross-border cooperation, coordination and information sharing<br></strong>Authorities should cooperate and coordinate with each other, both domestically and internationally, to foster efficient and effective communication, information sharing and consultation in order to support each other as appropriate in fulfilling their respective mandates and to encourage consistency of regulatory and supervisory outcomes.<br><br></li>
<li><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Recommendation 4: Governance<br></strong>Authorities, as appropriate, should require that crypto-asset issuers and service providers have in place and disclose a comprehensive governance framework with clear and direct lines of responsibility and accountability for all functions and activities they are conducting. The governance framework should be proportionate to their risk, size, complexity and systemic importance, and to the financial stability risk that may be posed by activity or market in which the crypto-asset issuers and service providers are participating. It should provide for clear and direct lines of responsibility and accountability for the functions and activities they are conducting.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 5: Risk management</strong><br>Authorities, as appropriate, should require crypto-asset service providers to have an effective risk management framework in place that comprehensively addresses all material risks associated with their activities. The framework should be proportionate to the risk, size, complexity, and systemic importance, and to the financial stability risk that may be posed by the activity or market in which they are participating. Authorities should, to the extent necessary to achieve regulatory outcomes comparable to those in traditional finance, require crypto-asset issuers to address the financial stability risk that may be posed by the activity or market in which they are participating.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 6: Data collection, recording and reporting</strong><br>Authorities, as appropriate, should require that crypto-asset issuers and service providers have in place robust frameworks, including systems and processes, for collecting, storing, safeguarding, and the timely and accurate reporting of data, including relevant policies, procedures and infrastructures needed, in each case proportionate to their risk, size, complexity and systemic importance. Authorities should have access to the data as necessary and appropriate to fulfil their regulatory, supervisory and oversight mandates.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 7: Disclosures</strong><br>Authorities should require that crypto-asset issuers and service providers disclose to users and relevant stakeholders comprehensive, clear and transparent information regarding their governance framework, operations, risk profiles and financial conditions, as well as the products they provide and activities they conduct.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 8: Addressing financial stability risks arising from interconnections and interdependencies</strong><br>Authorities should identify and monitor the relevant interconnections, both within the crypto-asset ecosystem, as well as between the crypto-asset ecosystem and the wider financial system. Authorities should address financial stability risks that arise from these interconnections and interdependencies.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 9: Comprehensive regulation of crypto-asset service providers with multiple functions</strong><br>Authorities should ensure that crypto-asset service providers and their affiliates that combine multiple functions and activities, where permissible, are subject to appropriate regulation, supervision and oversight that comprehensively address the risks associated with individual functions and the risks arising from the combination of functions, including but not limited to requirements regarding conflicts of interest and separation of certain functions, activities, or incorporation, as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations for the oversight of  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">G</span>lobal <span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span>table<span style="text-decoration: underline;">c</span>oin Arrangements (GSC's)</h3>
<p class="msg msg--info">I'm not exactly sure when a stablecoin qualifies as a "global" stablecoin, but currently the largest stablecoins (by market cap) are: USDT (Tether), USDC (Centre Consortium, founded by Circle and Coinbase), DAI (MakerDAO &amp; Maker Protocol)</p>
</div>
<div class="lightweight-accordion-body">
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation 1: Authorities’ readiness to regulate and supervise global stablecoin arrangements</strong><br>Authorities should have and utilise the appropriate powers and tools, and adequate resources, to comprehensively regulate, supervise, and oversee a GSC arrangement and its associated functions and activities, and enforce relevant laws and regulations effectively.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 2: Comprehensive oversight of GSC activities and functions</strong><br>Authorities should apply comprehensive and effective regulatory, supervisory and oversight requirements consistent with international standards to GSC arrangements on a functional basis and proportionate to their risks insofar as such requirements are consistent with their respective mandates.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 3: Cross-border cooperation, coordination and information sharing</strong><br>Authorities should cooperate and coordinate with each other, both domestically and internationally, to foster efficient and effective communication, information sharing and consultation in order to support each other in fulfilling their respective mandates and to ensure comprehensive regulation, supervision, and oversight of a GSC arrangement across borders and sectors, and to encourage consistency of regulatory and supervisory outcomes.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 4: Governance structures and decentralised operations</strong><br>Authorities should require that GSC arrangements have in place and disclose a comprehensive governance framework with clear and direct lines of responsibility and accountability for all functions and activities within the GSC arrangement.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 5: Risk management</strong><br>Authorities should require that GSC arrangements have effective risk management frameworks in place that comprehensively address all material risks associated with their functions and activities, especially with regard to operational resilience, cyber security safeguards and AML/CFT measures, as well as “fit and proper” requirements, if applicable, and consistent with jurisdictions’ laws and regulations.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 6: Data storage and access to data</strong><br>Authorities should require that GSC arrangements have in place robust frameworks, including systems and processes for the collecting, storing, safeguarding and timely and accurate reporting of data. Authorities should have access to the data as necessary and appropriate to fulfil their regulatory, supervisory and oversight mandates.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 7: Recovery and resolution of the GSC</strong><br>Authorities should require that GSC arrangements have appropriate recovery and resolution plans.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 8: Disclosures</strong><br>Authorities should require that GSC issuers and, where applicable, other participants in the GSC arrangements provide all users and relevant stakeholders with comprehensive and transparent information to understand the functioning of the GSC arrangement, including with respect to the governance framework, any conflicts of interest and their management, redemption rights, stabilisation mechanism, operations, risk management framework and financial condition.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 9: Redemption rights, stabilisation, and prudential requirements</strong><br>Authorities should require that GSC arrangements provide a robust legal claim to all users against the issuer and/or underlying reserve assets and guarantee timely redemption. For GSCs referenced to a single fiat currency, redemption should be at par into fiat. To maintain a stable value at all times and mitigate the risks of runs, authorities should require GSC arrangements to have an effective stabilisation mechanism, clear redemption rights and meet prudential requirements.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 10: Conformance with regulatory, supervisory and oversight requirements before commencing operations</strong><br>Authorities should require that GSC arrangements meet all applicable regulatory, supervisory and oversight requirements of a particular jurisdiction before commencing any operations in that jurisdiction and adapt to new regulatory requirements as necessary and as appropriate.</li>

                <p class="msg msg--highlight  msg--info">If you are interested in understanding what is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and its usefulness, I suggest you consult your favourite search engine first, before getting into the nitty-gritty technical details 🔬</p>
<p>Here we are, a first article on <strong>Central Bank Digital Currencies</strong>! I will mainly focus on the <strong>digital euro</strong> (and for now, its pilot projects), but there is a lot of security &amp; risk related research from other international sources, that I will cover as well.</p>
<p>Most countries are exploring a CBDC by now. According to the Atlantic Council, 130 countries, representing 98 percent of global GDP, are exploring a CBDC . The Atlantic council has <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a slick website tracking CBDC projects</a>, so make sure to have a look: <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/"></a></p>

<h3>One does not simply 'launch' a CBDC</h3>
<p>Anyway, besides countries' interest in CBDC's, one of the more interesting aspects (imho) is <em>how </em>exactly is (or better: will be) this implemented, and why? Enter the many different, <em>possible</em> CBDC architectures.<em> (Spoiler alert: it does not necessarily need to be based on Distributed Ledger Technology)</em></p>
<p>Here is a great article by Rainer Böhme &amp; Raphael Auer for the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), explaining different designs with their pros and cons: <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/cbdc-architectures-financial-system-and-central-bank-future">https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/cbdc-architectures-financial-system-and-central-bank-future</a></p>

                <p>It is that time of the year again! <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickd_de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@patrickd</a> published his recap of last year's noteworthy security incidents from the Ethereum sphere, without all the CT drama:</p>

<p>He focuses on the technical details, in order for other researchers to learn about them and -especially- to make sure these vulnerabilites are spotted in future audits and reviews.</p>
<p>What a benevolent person, he probably is the living incarnation of the "sharing is caring" attitude in the Web3 community (plus, ask him a technical question, and you always get an elaborate, yet to the point, answer).</p>
